# Introduction to Data Output

## Functional Overview

Data output is the process of synchronizing tables from the `input` or `etl` transformation layers of the data warehouse to the `output` layer, making the data available for external query and analysis services.

## Feature Details
- To ensure timely synchronization, each output task can select a maximum of 10 tables.
- To prevent disruption to external services, the platform only synchronizes schema changes related to adding new columns and increasing column length from the source tables.
