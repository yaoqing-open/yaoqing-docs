# Data Integration Introduction

## Overview

Data Integration supports real-time data synchronization from various data sources for multiple scenarios. It synchronizes multiple databases and tables to the platform through a one-time full import followed by real-time incremental updates, offering the following features:

- **Real-time:** Supports data synchronization at the second level.
- **Reliability:** Ensures data consistency and accuracy through various mechanisms such as error recovery and automatic retries.
- **Versatility:**
  - **Diverse Data Sources:** Supports a variety of data sources.
  - **Flexible Scenarios:** Supports integrated full and incremental synchronization, database/table sharding, and wide table consolidation.
- **Maintainability:** Supports job monitoring and log viewing for easy troubleshooting.
- **Ease of Use:** Features a user-friendly interface where users only need to configure essential information.

## Feature Details
### Use Cases

| Scenario | Description |
|---|---|
| One-to-One | Replicates the source table's structure and data to a target table on a one-to-one basis, ensuring both are synchronized. |
| Table Merging | Automatically merges multiple sharded source tables into a single standard target table, suitable for sharding scenarios like those using ShardingSphere. |
| Wide Table Consolidation | Merges multiple source tables into a single wide table in the target data warehouse using join keys, facilitating unified queries and efficient analysis. |
