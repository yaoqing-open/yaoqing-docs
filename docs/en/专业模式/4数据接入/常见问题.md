### Troubleshooting Ingestion Errors
Common causes for ingestion errors include:
- The Kafka connection is incorrect, resulting in a "Topic not found" error.
- Improper use of data types in the source database. For example, a `TINYINT(1)` field storing numbers other than `0` and `1`.

### No Ingestion Errors, But No Data Is Received
- For TiDB Cloud ingestion, please check the Kafka Topic for incremental data. (Ensure that this data was generated after the ingestion task was successfully created.)
