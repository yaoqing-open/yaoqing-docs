## Data Transformation Guidelines
1. A `WHERE` clause is mandatory to filter table data. This prevents the real-time processing load from growing indefinitely and causing system failures.
2. When performing multi-table joins, place the smaller table on the left side of the join whenever possible.
3. Whenever possible, apply filters and aggregations to each table *before* joining them. This reduces the pressure on the join state.
