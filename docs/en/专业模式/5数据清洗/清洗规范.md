## Data Transformation Guidelines
1. A `WHERE` clause is mandatory to filter table data. This prevents the real-time processing load from growing indefinitely and causing system failures.
  - **Daily Jobs** - Are restricted to processing data from the last 2 days. Historical data backfill is supported once per hour, requiring the condition `where time >= LAST_2_DAY()`  or `where timestamp >= LAST_2_DAY_STRING()` .
  - **Hourly Jobs** - Are restricted to processing data from the last 3 hours. Historical data backfill is supported every 5 minutes, requiring the condition `where time >= LAST_3_HOUR()` or `where timestamp >= LAST_2_DAY_STRING()` .
  - **Minute-level Jobs** - Are restricted to processing data from the last 2 minutes. Historical data backfill is supported every 5 minutes, requiring the condition `where time >= LAST_2_MINUTE()` or `where timestamp >= LAST_2_DAY_STRING()` .
2. When performing multi-table joins, place the smaller table on the left side of the join whenever possible.
3. Whenever possible, apply filters and aggregations to each table *before* joining them. This reduces the pressure on the join state.
